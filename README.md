# AddressAutocomplete

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.2.3.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the Address Autocomplete Angular application locally.

## Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/webdev34/angular-material-autocomplete-address-search.git
cd address-autocomplete
```

## Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```
## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
